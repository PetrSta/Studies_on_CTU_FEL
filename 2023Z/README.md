[HW03] Template for the homework. <br>

<h3><ins>Assignments:</ins></h3> <br>
The code will not run without API keys for Open weather api. My keys were removed from the code. <br>
The API keys can be added for [HW01] in ManageCities.xaml.cs, MainWindow.xaml.cs. [HW02] -> MVC / MVP model.cs. [HW03] in MainViewModel.cs. <br>
[HW01] Use OpenWeatherMap API to create simple app to check weather in selected cities. Following template. <br>
[HW02] This contains 3 parts. Part 1: create a console app for weather -> similar to HW01. Part 2: update given template according to instructions (combo box, event handler, binding). Part 3: update given template according to instructions (commands, value convertor, sliders, images). <br>
