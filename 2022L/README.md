<h1>2022L</h1>
<p>
This file contains codes from summer of 2022. <br>
In this semester you can find 3 subjects: <br>
Computer architecture, Programming in java(JAVA) and Computer networks (Python). <br>
</p>

<p>
<h2>APO - computer architecture</h2>
This subject is about principles behind computers, processors and assembler. <br>

<h3><ins>Assignments:</ins></h3> <br>
[Cache] Implementation of convolution for pixels - calculating pixels as weighted result of neighbouring pixels. <br>
</p>

<p>
<h2>PJV - programming in java</h2>
This subject teaches basic of OOP (object-oriented programming) and Java. <br>
*** Some of the assignments include code provided by school. *** <br>
These are: <br>
[HW02] TextIO.java <br>

<h3><ins>Assignments:</ins></h3> <br>
[HW01] Simple calculator, operation is selected first then operands are given. <br>
[HW02] Calculation of average value and standard deviation from sequence of numbers. <br>
[HW03] Circular array queue implementation. <br>
[HW04] Try to brute force password. It is simplified: we know exact length of password and set of characters which create the password. <br>
[HW05] Implementation of binary tree. <br>
[Chess] This is the semestral work for this subject. We could choose what to do and I decided to create a chess program. I also didnt follow any tutorial to challenge myself. <br>
</p>

<p>
<h2>PSIA - Computer networks</h2>
This subject teaches theory about computer networks. It also allows you to try programming network protocols. <br>
The assignments were create in a team of 2 students. I lay no claim to this code because of this. <br>

<h3><ins>Assignments:</ins></h3> <br>
[HW01] Simple receiver. <br>
[HW02] Stopwait receiver. <br>
[HW03] Selective repeat receiver. <br>
