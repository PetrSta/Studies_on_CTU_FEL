<h1>2022Z</h1>
<p>
This file contains codes from winter of 2022. <br>
In this semester you can find 2 subjects: <br>
Algorithmization(JAVA) and Operating systems(BASH, C). <br>
</p>

<p>
<h2>ALG - Algorithmization</h2>
This subject has some freedom in language usage, I myself used JAVA. Objective is to create effective algorithms for given problems. <br>

<h3><ins>Assignments:</ins></h3> <br>
<!--- Description of assignments is succinct because otherwise each would need multiple lines --->
[HW01] Simulation of robots lighting coridors. <br>
[HW02] Finding best placement in a grid with restrictions. <br>
[HW03] Searching tree data structure. <br>
[HW04] Pathfinding in a grid. <br>
[HW07] Pathfinding in graph. <br>
</p>

<h2>OSY - Operating systems.</h2>
This subject teaches low-level coding. Foe. one of the homeworks is creation of malloc for NOVA. <br>
*** Some of the assignments include code provided by school. *** <br>
These are: <br>
[HW04] nd.c, nd.h, nsd.c, nsd.h, nsd_main.c <br>
[HW06] factory.c -> everything except cmd condition branches <br>
[HW08] hexconv.c -> only some parts were added <br>
[HW10] ec_syscall.cc -> mostly written as part of the assignment -> it is only a part of NOVA core <br>
[HW11] ec_syscall.cc -> -||- [HW10], mem_alloc.c -> syscall2, nbrk were already included <br>

<h3><ins>Assignments:</ins></h3> <br>
[HW02] Create a BASH script which loads PATH to file, depending on the file type it writes out information about it. <br>
[HW03] Create a BASH script which depending on given switch acts accordingly. Includes file searching and text editing. <br>
[HW04] Create a C program using forks and pipes accordingly. <br>
[HW05] Create a C program with prod-cons using semaphores. <br>
[HW06] Create a C program - working factory - synchronization using conditional variables. <br>
[HW08] Create a C program which loads number inputs and writes them in hexadecimal. Do NOT use any standard libraries. <br>
[HW10] Implement nbrk in NOVA. <br>
[HW11] Implement malloc in NOVA. <br>
