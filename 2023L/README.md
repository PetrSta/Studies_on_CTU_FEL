# 2023L
<p>
This file contains codes from summer of 2023. 
In this semester you can find 4 subjects: <br>
Database systems(SQL), Optimalization(Matlab), Paralel and distributed calculations(C++, JAVA) and Basics of artificial inteligence (Python). <br>
</p>

<p>
## DBS - Database systems
This subject teaches basics of SQL and database design. <br>
<!--- Přepsat po přidání kódu --->
Most of the assignment were submited as PDF files with code in them. The code itself will be added in separate file. <br>
They are also all part of semestral work -> designing and creating database. <br>

[HW01] Create conceptual ER model. <br>
[HW02] Transform the conceptual model from HW01 into relational model. <br>
[HW03] Transform the relational model from HW02 into ER model and into resulting SQL database and queries. <br>
[HW04] Create additional queries foe. : use trigger, transaction, index. <br>
[HW05] Use databse from HW03 to create JPA application. <br>
</p>
