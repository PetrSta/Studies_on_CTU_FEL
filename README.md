<h1>Studies_on_CTU_FEL</h1>
<p>
Hello my name is Petr Stanke. I studied on CTU FEL (Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague) from autumn 2021 till summer 2024.<br>
I studied open informatics with specialization on computer games and graphics.<br>
This repository was created to store my work from school for showcase. It is split into semesters eg. 2022L -> means summer of 2022 and 2022Z -> means winter of 2022.
Each semester then contains multiple subjects with each having its own README and containing multiple files. <br>
<ins> In some cases I am not uploading whole homework just the student created files which were required. </ins>
Currently work from winter of 2021 till summer of 2024 can be found here.
</p>

<p>
Main purpose of this repository is to store codes for homeworks from my studies. Needless to say do it is not a good idea to copy and paste code from here and claim it as your own if you study on CTU. <br>

Because of this I wont share details for the taks. I have links to them stored locally. <br>

Since the semestral work from summer of 2024 is too big you can you can visit this website for it: https://cent.felk.cvut.cz/courses/PGR/archives/2023-2024/S-FEL/stankpe4/. <br> 
It is archive of semesteral works from PGR (programming of graphics). The programming is done in OpenGL using framework provided by school. <br>
