<h1>Studies_on_CTU_FEL</h1>
<p>
Hello my name is Petr Stanke. I currently study on CTU FEL (Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague).<br>
Curently I study open informatics with specialization on computer games and graphics.<br>
This repository was created to store my work from school for showcase. It is split into semesters eg. 2022L -> means summer of 2022 and 2022Z -> means winter of 2022.
Each semester then contains multiple subjects with each having its own README and containing multiple files. <br>
<ins> In some cases I am not uploading whole homework just the student created files which were required. </ins>
Currently work from winter of 2021 till summer of 2024 can be found here.

Main purpose of this repository is to store codes for homeworks from my studies. Needless to say do it is not a good idea to copy and paste code from here and claim it as your own if you study on CTU. <br>

Because of this I wont share details for the taks. I have links to them stored locally. For simple tasks I will write them out. For more complex tasks I am currently thinking of a easier sollution. <br>

For my work from summer of 2024 you can visit this website: https://cent.felk.cvut.cz/courses/PGR/archives/2023-2024/S-FEL/stankpe4/. It is archive of semesteral works from PGR (programming of graphics). The programming is done in OpenGL using framework provided by school.
