<p>
This file contains codes from winter of 2021. <br>
In this semester you can find 2 subjects: <br>
Procedural programming(C) and Problem solving and games(Python). <br>
</p>

<p>
<h2>PRP - Procedural programming</h2>
This is the first programming subject teaching basic habits for coding and basic of C programming language. <br>
*** Some of the assignments include code provided by school. *** <br>
These are: <br>
All makefiles. <br>
[HW08] queue.h <br>
[HW09] most of graph.h, graph_creator.c, bin2txt.c, txt2bin.c <br>
[HW10] most of the code was already provided, function pq_update was changed and implementation of dijkstra.h was changed <br>

<h3><ins>Assignments:</ins></h3> <br>
[HW01] Loading of input (2 numbers), checking if input is valid. Then printing output using input values. <br>
[HW02] Similar to HW01 but now including random amount of numbers on input. <br>
[HW03] Load input of 2 number (width and height) and then print house of that dimension according to given rules. <br>
[HW04] Load input of numbers, check if they are valid. Then do prime decomposition of these numbers. <br>
[HW05] Caesars cipher solving using brute force. We have 2 messages which we compare, and the most frequent shift is considered valid. <br>
[HW06] Implementation of matrix calculations. Addition, subtraction and multiplication. <br>
[HW07] Search for all occurrences of given text in given file. <br>
[HW08] Circular queue implementation using array. <br>
[HW09] Saving and loading graph into / from file. Both in text format and binary. <br>
[HW10] Finishing implementation (provided by school) of Dijkstra's algorithm. <br>
</p>

<h2>RPH - Problem solving and games.</h2>
This is subject for problem solving and simple games. <br>

<h3><ins>Assignments:</ins></h3> <br>
[HW02] Implementation of vector multiplication. <br>
[HW03] Implement testing according to given rules. <br>
[Prisoner's_dilemma_1] Implementation of player for Prisoner's_dilemma game. <br>
[Prisoner's_dilemma_2] Improved implementation of player Prisoner's_dilemma game for tournament with other players. <br>
[Reversi_1] Implementation of player for reversi game. <br>
[Reversi_2] Implementation of player for reversi game tournament. <br>
